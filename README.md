Code examples accompanying a video series introducing working with promises by example.

## Install

Run this command to install all required libraries for the demos

`yarn`

## Running the demos

To run any demo, run the following, replacing the fake path with the path to the relevant demo

`node src/path/to/demo.js`

there are a couple of basic demos which have shortcuts

`yarn demo1`

`yarn demo2`

`yarn demo3`

## Doing further experimentation

It's recommended you use this repo for your initial further experiments with enquirer, node-postgres, and axios.  It is suggested you just make another directory under `src/` for your code, and either start a new js file from from scratch in there, or copy into that directory one of the demo files that's relevant to your task, and then modify it to accomplish your task.
